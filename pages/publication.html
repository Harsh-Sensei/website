            <p class="abstract" style="color: black;">Abstract : This work presents an adaptive group testing framework
                for the range-based high dimensional near neighbor search
                problem. The proposed method detects high-similarity vectors from an extensive collection of high dimensional vectors, where each vector represents an image descriptor.
                Our method efficiently marks each item in the collection as
                neighbor or non-neighbor on the basis of a cosine distance
                threshold without exhaustive search. Like other methods in
                the domain of large scale retrieval, our approach exploits
                the assumption that most of the items in the collection are
                unrelated to the query. Unlike other methods, it does not assume a large difference between the cosine similarity of the
                query vector with the least related neighbor and that with
                the least unrelated non-neighbor. Following the procedure
                of binary splitting, a multi-stage adaptive group testing algorithm, we split the set of items to be searched into half
                at each step, and perform dot product tests on smaller and
                smaller subsets, many of which we are able to prune away.
                We experimentally show that our method achieves a speedup over exhaustive search by a factor of more than ten with
                an accuracy same as that of exhaustive search, on a variety of large datasets. For theoretical analysis, we model the
                distribution of cosine distances between a query vector and
                the vectors in the collection using a truncated exponential
                distribution, and demonstrate that this is a good model for
                cosine distances in practice. Equipped with this, we present
                a theoretical analysis of the expected number of distance
                computations per query and the probability that a pool with
                a certain number of members will be pruned. In this way,
                our method exploits very useful and practical distributional
                properties unlike other methods. In our method, all required data structures are created purely offline. Moreover,
                our method does not impose any strong assumptions on the
                number of true near neighbors, is adaptible to streaming
                settings where new vectors are dynamically added to the
                database, and does not require any parameter tuning.</p>

            <p class="abstract" style="color: black;">Abstract : Rendering virtual objects in augmented reality presents a formidable challenge, 
                primarily in ensuring an immersive viewer experience. The ambient lighting conditions within the
                 environment where these virtual objects are placed can vary significantly, causing a noticeable 
                 discrepancy between the rendered object and its surroundings. To address this issue, various 
                 techniques have been proposed, with one common approach being the precomputation of lighting 
                 information within the virtual object. In this research, we introduce a novel methodology for the 
                 efficient and accurate prediction of the spherical harmonics representing environmental illumination. 
                 Our approach leverages a reflective spherical probe positioned within the environment to capture its lighting conditions, and predict the spherical harmonics of the ambient lighting. 
                 The spherical harmonics are then used over bake lighting in the textures of the virtual object. Our method circumvents data-driven techniques, 
                 thereby achieving superior generalization, reduced inference time and enhancement in the overall quality of augmented reality object rendering. 
                 We implement our pipeline for rendering virtual objects using Unity with the help of ARcore package.
